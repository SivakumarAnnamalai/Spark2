1) Choosing number of executors, executors per cores and memory for each executor is so important.
    E.g: If we have 6 nodes with 16 Cores each and 64GB RAM
    a) Most Granular: 96 executors (1Core/4GB RAM each)
       Cons: Not using benefits of running multiple tasks in same executor
    b) Least Granular: 6 executors (16Cores/64GB RAM each)
       Cons: Need to leave some memory overhead for OS and Daemons(Spark/Hadoop)
    c) Least Granular With Overhead: 6 executors (15Cores/63GB RAM each)
       Cons: Executors memory controls the heap size. Need some overhead(spark.yarn.executor.memory.overhead) for offheap memory.Default is max(384MB, 0.07*spark.executor.memory)
             YARN AM needs a Core on client machine when you run on Client mode
             YARN AM needs a Core on NM when you run on Cluster mode
             15 Cores per executor can lead to bad HDFS I/O throughput. Best is to keep under 5 Cores per executor
    d) Right answer is:
       5 Cores per executor - This provides max HDFS throughput
       Number of Cores on the cluster is 90 Cores after Overhead. So, the number of executors would be 18(3 on each node). 1 should be left to AM and remaining is 17 executors.
       Each node has 63GB RAM after overhead. So, 63/3 = 21GB RAM
       spark.yarn.executor.memory.overhead on each executor would be 21*0.07 = 1.47GB ~ 2GB.
       Reamaining, 19GB RAM for each executor.

2) Dynamic Allocation
    Pros: Allows spark to dynamically scale the cluster resources allocated to your application based on the workload
          Works with Spark on YARN mode

3) Number of partitions on Spark RDD
    Dont have too few partitions which will degrade the performance
    Dont have too big partitions which will fail during shuffle
        Spark Shuffle block can not be greater than 2GB data
        Overflow exception happens when the data size exceeds 2GB
        Spark uses ByteBuffer as abstraction for blocks which is limited by Integer.MAX_SIZE(2GB)
        This is mostly problematics when we use SparkSQL as the default number of partitions to use is 200 when doing shuffle.
        a) Number of partitions has to be increased to avoid this issue
            Use spark.sql.shuffle.partitions property on SQL
            Use coalesce(n) or repartition(n) on other spark applications
        b) Avoid the Skew on the data if the data is not distributed evenly
    Whats the recommended partitions size: Rule of thumb is around 128MB per Partition
    Spark uses different datastructure when the number of partitions less than 2000 and more than that.
    Bump the partitions to more than 2000 if its close to 2000.

4) Skew issues - How to solve?
    Salting
        Normal Key : "ABC",
        Salted Key : "ABC" + Random.nextInt(saltFactor)
        Two Stage Aggregation
            - Stage one to do operations on the salted keys
            - Stage two to do operations on unsalted keys
    Isolated Salting
        Second stage only required for isolated keys
    Isolated Map Joins
        Filter out Isolated keys and use map join/aggregate on those
        Normal reduce on the rest of the data
        This can remove a large amount of data being shuffled

5) Shuffles are to be avoided
    MapSide Reduction where possible
    Think about partitioning or bucketing ahead of time
    Do as much as possible with a single shuffle
    only send what you have to send
    Avoid skew and Cartesians

6) ReduceByKey over GroupByKey
    ReduceByKey can do almost anything that groupByKey can do like
        Aggregations,
        Windowing
        Use Memory
        ReduceByKey has a fixed limit of memory requirements
        GroupByKey is unbound and dependent on Data
        Avoid reduceByKey When the input and output value types are different

7) TreeReduce over Reduce
    TreeReduce and Reduce return some result to the driver program
    TreeReduce does more work on the executors while Reduce brings everything back to the driver

8) Use Complex or Nested Types
9) Shading concept on maven
10) Executor Memory = spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead + spark.executor.memory(which includes spark.shuffle.memoryFraction + spark.storage.memoryFraction)
11) Too many open files
12) SecondarySorting - Use the transformation repartitionAndSortWithinPartitions
